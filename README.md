Python code for the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle

# Note: This is my first personal project on GitHub, so pardon me for any rough edges. Unfortunately I am not a good GUI programmer at the moment, so I did not include a graphical version of Tower of Hanoi here. But I am confident that my skills will improve as I learn more.

The Tower of Hanoi is an old puzzle in which the player must try to get all disks from the first tower (the leftmost one) to the last tower (the rightmost one). The disks have different sizes; only the topmost disk can be moved from a tower, and disks must always be smaller than the disks under them. And when the player moves disks, the disks always go as far down the Tower as possible. You can read more about the Tower of Hanoi puzzle here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi

In order to try your hand at solving this puzzle, you will have to download hanoi_console.py and execute it from a command prompt. Of course, since I wrote this project in Python 3.6, you will need to have that on your computer as well. You can download a version of Python 3.6 here: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

I hope you enjoy this little project of mine :). I look forward to learning more about Python and programming in general.
